        <!--This HTML document creates a simple web page that displays a wrapper containing an emoji, a paragraph element with an ID of "joke," and a button with an ID of "btn." The page includes a link to an external CSS file ("style.css") and an external JavaScript file ("script.js"). Here's a breakdown:-->
        <!--This meta tag sets the viewport width to the device width and sets the initial scale to 1.0, ensuring proper rendering on various devices.-->
        <!--This line links to an external CSS file named "style.css" to apply styles to the HTML elements.-->
        <!--The content is wrapped in a div element with a class of "wrapper."
It includes a span element with a smiling emoji (ðŸ˜‚).
A p element with an ID of "joke" is present, likely intended to display a random joke.
A button element with an ID of "btn" is provided to trigger the retrieval of a random joke.-->
        <!--This line includes an external JavaScript file named "script.js" to add dynamic behavior and functionality to the webpage.-->
